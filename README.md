> **Abstract**
> 
> Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols serve as a fundamental yet intricate component of distributed data management systems in untrustworthy environments. BFT protocols exhibit different design principles and performance characteristics under varying workloads and fault scenarios. The proliferation of BFT protocols and their growing complexity have made it increasingly challenging to analyze the performance and possible application scenarios of each protocol. This demonstration showcases BFTGym, an interactive platform that allows audience members to (1) evaluate, compare, and gather insights into the performance of various BFT protocols under a wide range of conditions, and (2) prototype new BFT protocols rapidly.
